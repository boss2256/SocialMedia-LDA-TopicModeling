Wouldn't rent control, price controls on necessities and reworking the subsidies for housing/education/medical services be a far better solution for the long run? 

And how do all these CDC vouchers, and cash gifts address the stagnating/insufficient industry median wages that our people have to put up with, while standards of living continue to rise?",17/2/2024 13:32,Facebook,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0

If you really look into the whole budget, there is really nothing but in medical term it is simply just giving out panadol (pain killer) to numb the senses for a short period of time so that one will get used to it for losing a limb in the long term. 

The high cost of living is there to stay forever, if I may say the least  but the ""panadol"" is only for a short period of relief. 

You are absolutely right, instead of giving out goodies (short term), they should have tackled the high cost of living in every aspect. 

So in short they are simply trying to buy vote to solve the symptom instead of the cause. 

The way I look at it, is that they are simply running out of ideas but finding the easiest way out by doing this. 

Over the years or even decades you can see so many blunders thay have made and they simply just swept it all under carpet. For these I will leave it for another day to comment.",17/2/2024 14:06,Facebook,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0

Because according to the government, one can't have the cake and eat it.

If you want higher interest, you lose the liquidity. So if you have SA when you are 55 years old and above, you happy you withdraw, you not happy you keep and government pays you 4%.

So the government stand is, if you want high interest, you put in RA, but money is locked till 65 and released monthly.

If you want to have flexibility of withdrawing, then you withdraw from your OA which earns a lower interest.

So you can only choose one between higher interest and liquidity.",16/2/2024 20:36,Facebook,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Reserve not enough meh?  Want to take such drastic actions when most Singaporeans are almost under the bus.  Lower n middle income Singaporeans will be adversely affected with these budget changes!!!

Most will not be able to reach this new requirement of $420k in full retirement account.  FOR MANY, Already can’t reach RA of $250K ~ NOW (before the change) n now further increase!!!!  Infuriating!!!!  ABSURDITY!!!!!!

This establishment does not listen to the pains of ordinary Singaporeans N BARELY DO ENOUGH.  

Should the affected Singaporeans continue to support the MIW n still vote for the MIW?
