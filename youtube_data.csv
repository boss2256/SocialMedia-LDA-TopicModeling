@GASIA-cw8iw,"Current rent for the expiring lease: S$5000 per month
New rent on the new TA: S$7000 per month
The rate hike of S$2000 is GDP growth or inflation?
For the landlord it is a solid S$2000 per month taxable income, right?

NTUC and other supermarkets made more revenue by selling more products or by increasing prices?
SMRT and bus companies made more revenue by taking more passengers or by increasing fares?
Lawyers earned more by serving more clients or by increasing fees?

Singapore's bubble GDP is sustained by inflating costs, prices, and fees!

What is real GDP growth?
BYD of China just surpassed Tesla as the world's largest manufacturer of EVs.
China just surpassed Japan as the world's largest exporter of automobiles.

A 1000 sq ft condo is S$2 million now.
A 4-rm HDB flat is S$500k now.

@WWK186,The 4+% earned in retirement account is not withdrawable when you pass on. CPF will only refund the remaining  premium to your beneficiaries. Does not make sense to put so much money there. How is govt protecting seniors who are vulnerable to scams and may not be savy in investing. They are now forced to find alternatives due to this sudden policy  change.

@darrenpalanisamy91,"Been watching some of these videos incl the above by CNA but none are mentioning, how all these changes helping fellow Singaporean's living abroad? 
1)  S'porean's are not benefitting the special grants just because they're residing abroad, but we're S'poreans. So the govt don't NEED to give us these benefits?

2) How abt S'poreans who don't own any properties & residing abroad permanently? 

3) At 55, all we can withdraw is 5k. How abt the usage of Medisave for all those living abroad and again for those who don't own any properties in S'pore & having a Medical Condition and /or life threatening and not able to work? We can only use it in S'pore? How is it right for a S'porean living abroad? 

Can CNA or any one shed some light here for the benefit of those 55 and above, living overseas?

Now he decided Year 2025 those 55 and above will have their SA clozed.  He just want people to transfer to RA to top up to ERS.  Not everybody is aware once our money is transferred to RA at age 55, at that point the 4% interest earned goes into a common pool, and so if member pass on, the money in his RA gets disbursed to his nominated beneficiary but not the 4% interest earned in the RA.  So not worth to top up to ERS, if can meet the FRS will do.  So if at any mth the small payout is not enough, at least still can have some money a member can withdraw fm his OA.

@friedrice7707,"Closing CPF SA was another dick move after his GST hikes. PAP was the one that gave us the 4% SA account in the first place. What's wrong with citizens making a decent living and accumulating wealth in SA when those monies are meant for our eventual retirement? How can we have faith in the new PM when he can just changed the goal post as and when he likes? It's like the bank introduced a annual 4% Special Saving Plan, I diligently put in the money all these years. But one day the bank said next year they will forcefully close my Special Saving Plan and transfer all the money to the normal Saving Account that's paying a much lower interest. What kind of bank does such unethical thing? From this episode, having PAP governing my CPF is a huge policy risk, I will never transfer more than the required BRS to RA. I am sure down the road PAP will change the goal post again on OA, Retirement Account or CPF Life.

@jaskim9652,"Wealth and Riches blind the wealthy person from morality and from empathy and sympathy towards the poor. 

Those in the gov who are rich and intelligent, are you helping and serving the rich and wealthy, or are you truly serving the nation, majority of whom do not have access to the privileges of the HNW.. are you truly caring for and serving the poor? 
Why is it that the Christian organizations (eg ywam, etc) are doing so much more for the marginalised, the homeless, the prostitutes’ kids (btw these prostitutes do not want to be one), the migrant workers, the cleaners, the poor elderlies living in rental flats, when they have much lesser resources than the gov?! These Christian volunteers stooped and humbled themselves to buy food and necessities and eat with the migrant workers on the hdb floor, touch the hands of, bless and encourage the sick and poor wherever they are, etc.
There is way more abundant resources to go around if the gov were to rethink how to truly serve those who needs the resources MORE. Redirect from serving those who already have so much more than others in the nation, to truly serving those with lesser. Redirect from the ‘finer things in life’ to what’s needed. 
Walk the ground, ask God for humility to help soften your heart and open your eyes to see those who are struggling and suffering. To see that the system is broken and the poorer folks cannot survive and play by the system. To see that all humans are made in the image of God, all are precious and equal. To know that leaders have to be accountable for what they’ve done (judgement day). In turn, your strategy will tweak, the percentages of your dedication of resources will change, your love towards the poor will change. You will begin to release the reign of the pursuit of wealth and materialism. More middle and lower class folks will be able to breathe and cope better. 

Here’s the purest truth that will set the rich free from ignorance: 

“It’s much harder for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God” 

Moral from the Story of rich man and Lazarus:
L uke 16:19-31 contains the account of a very rich man who lived a life of extreme luxury. Laid outside the gate of this rich man’s house, however, was an extremely poor man named Lazarus who simply hoped “to eat what fell from the rich man’s table” (v. 21). The rich man was completely indifferent to the plight of Lazarus, showing him no love, sympathy, or compassion whatsoever. Eventually, they both died. Lazarus went to heaven, and the rich man went to hell.


The Bible says our earthly lives are a “mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes” (James 4:14). Our earthly sojourn is exceedingly brief. Perhaps the greatest lesson to learn from this story, then, is that when death comes knocking on our door there is only one thing that matters: our relationship with Jesus Christ. “What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?” (Matthew 16:26; Mark 8:36).",2024-02-17T02:50:04Z,YouTube,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The incentives for ITE studens are horrible. $10,000 put into their CPF or pesa account is as good as not giving anything. Liquid cash would be a more practical incentive than putting it into CPF which essentially is just giving GIC/temasak holdings more money to do risky investments.

@reddotdiva,"Sure, you can put more money into the retirement amount but even though the retirement account earns the 4% interest. When you are in 65yo (latest at 70yo), you join CPF Life automatically. When you pass away, this interest is not withdrawal for your beneficiaries. The interest is pooled for the others who are in CPF Life.  If you live a long life, the amount of extra money you put into your RA (like Enhanced 3x or 4x), could have earned more interest in other products, which is available for your beneficiaries or your own use.

@user-dw3od3jo6m,"Simply a colossal waste of money. Put that in a single fund. Those who have the will for it should make an application, then you release however much funds they require. I completely do not believe 40, 50, 60 year olds would be spending time to train. And $4,000 wouldn't be sufficient to gain any new skills to a degree that would be considered competent.

I took a gander at the SkillFuture courses. I'd say over half of them are completely worthless with regards to upskilling yet charging thousands of dollars. This whole program looks like a money laundering scheme. There's no quality control. 

Look at this shit: 32 hours, introductory course, charges nearly $2k. A Udemy course would set you back $20 for the same thing.

@user-dw3od3jo6m,"What's the point in giving 40+ year olds that money? They're never going to use it. It'd be better spent on the 20+ year olds, especially the non-degree fellas. Any upskilling and reskilling that actually matter take time. A 40 hour part-time introductory course isn't going to land you any meaningful job that's not already within your current skillset. This age group won't go into unemployment for months and months to 'skill up'. If they have a job, they are holding on to it for dear life, because who knows when they're going to find another job at that age. And if they don't have a job, they need a job ASAP.  Singaporeans aren't rich enough to be forgoing paychecks to 'learn'. You have family, kids and house? Even more unlikely. Which is why it makes more sense to target the 20 year olds, because they have none of those burdens on their minds. SkillsFuture has been running for quite some time already. What do you have to show for it? Nothing. Invest in the workforce and pay them to go to school. Do that or do nothing.

@youtuberschannel12,"Real and effective policies -> Introduce defence tax for foreigners. Tax all new citizens and 1st gen PRs, 2 years of their full-time salary in exchange for NSF allowance. Give that money to all NSmen.

Introduce economic national service. Make them serve 2 years full time and 10 cycles of reservist. Make them do construction work or any job that is not valuable for Singaporeans to do. Then there is no need to import so many foreign workers. Overpopulation and housing issues are all solved.

Malaysians should be taxed 3.5x their salary to make it fair for Singaporeans. These taxes not only protect our economy and the Singdollar by preventing them from sending money back to their country, it can also be reinvested in Singapore and Singaporeans 

We can't let these freeloaders get away with it at the expense of Singapore and Singaporeans.",2024-02-16T20:39:54Z,YouTube,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
