@GASIA-cw8iw,"Current rent for the expiring lease: S$5000 per month
New rent on the new TA: S$7000 per month
The rate hike of S$2000 is GDP growth or inflation?
For the landlord it is a solid S$2000 per month taxable income, right?

NTUC and other supermarkets made more revenue by selling more products or by increasing prices?
SMRT and bus companies made more revenue by taking more passengers or by increasing fares?
Lawyers earned more by serving more clients or by increasing fees?

Singapore's bubble GDP is sustained by inflating costs, prices, and fees!

What is real GDP growth?
BYD of China just surpassed Tesla as the world's largest manufacturer of EVs.
China just surpassed Japan as the world's largest exporter of automobiles.

A 4-rm HDB flat is S$500k now.

@jaskim9652,"Wealth and Riches blind the wealthy person from morality and from empathy and sympathy towards the poor. 

Those in the gov who are rich and intelligent, are you helping and serving the rich and wealthy, or are you truly serving the nation, majority of whom do not have access to the privileges of the HNW.. are you truly caring for and serving the poor? 
Why is it that the Christian organizations (eg ywam, etc) are doing so much more for the marginalised, the homeless, the prostitutes‚Äô kids (btw these prostitutes do not want to be one), the migrant workers, the cleaners, the poor elderlies living in rental flats, when they have much lesser resources than the gov?! These Christian volunteers stooped and humbled themselves to buy food and necessities and eat with the migrant workers on the hdb floor, touch the hands of, bless and encourage the sick and poor wherever they are, etc.
There is way more abundant resources to go around if the gov were to rethink how to truly serve those who needs the resources MORE. Redirect from serving those who already have so much more than others in the nation, to truly serving those with lesser. Redirect from the ‚Äòfiner things in life‚Äô to what‚Äôs needed. 
Walk the ground, ask God for humility to help soften your heart and open your eyes to see those who are struggling and suffering. To see that the system is broken and the poorer folks cannot survive and play by the system. To see that all humans are made in the image of God, all are precious and equal. To know that leaders have to be accountable for what they‚Äôve done (judgement day). In turn, your strategy will tweak, the percentages of your dedication of resources will change, your love towards the poor will change. You will begin to release the reign of the pursuit of wealth and materialism. More middle and lower class folks will be able to breathe and cope better. 

Here‚Äôs the purest truth that will set the rich free from ignorance: 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much harder for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God‚Äù 

Moral from the Story of rich man and Lazarus:
L uke 16:19-31 contains the account of a very rich man who lived a life of extreme luxury. Laid outside the gate of this rich man‚Äôs house, however, was an extremely poor man named Lazarus who simply hoped ‚Äúto eat what fell from the rich man‚Äôs table‚Äù (v. 21). The rich man was completely indifferent to the plight of Lazarus, showing him no love, sympathy, or compassion whatsoever. Eventually, they both died. Lazarus went to heaven, and the rich man went to hell.


The Bible says our earthly lives are a ‚Äúmist that appears for a little while and then vanishes‚Äù (James 4:14). Our earthly sojourn is exceedingly brief. Perhaps the greatest lesson to learn from this story, then, is that when death comes knocking on our door there is only one thing that matters: our relationship with Jesus Christ. ‚ÄúWhat good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?‚Äù (Matthew 16:26; Mark 8:36).",2024-02-17 02:50:04+00:00,YouTube,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,YouTube,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,wealth riches blind wealthy person morality empathy sympathy poor gov rich intelligent helping serving rich wealthy truly serving nation majority access privileges hnw truly caring serving poor christian organizations ywam doing marginalised homeless prostitutes kids btw prostitutes want migrant workers cleaners poor elderlies living rental flats lesser resources gov christian volunteers stooped humbled buy food necessities eat migrant workers hdb floor touch hands bless encourage sick poor way abundant resources gov rethink truly serve needs resources redirect serving nation truly serving lesser redirect finer things life whats needed walk ground ask god humility help soften heart open eyes struggling suffering broken poorer folks survive play humans image god precious equal know leaders accountable theyve judgement day turn strategy tweak percentages dedication resources change love poor change begin release reign pursuit wealth materialism middle lower class folks able breathe cope better heres purest truth set rich free ignorance harder rich person enter kingdom god moral story rich man lazarus l uke contains account rich man lived life extreme luxury laid outside gate rich mans house extremely poor man named lazarus simply hoped eat fell rich mans table v rich man completely indifferent plight lazarus showing love sympathy compassion whatsoever eventually died lazarus went heaven rich man went hell bible says earthly lives mist appears little vanishes james earthly sojourn exceedingly brief greatest lesson learn story death comes knocking door thing matters relationship jesus christ good man gains world forfeits soul matthew mark

@joellim7010,"This is an example of PAP's failed policy. At 40 years old even if you go and upgrade yourself using skillfuture credits, employers will still choose to employ younger fresh graduates who are cheaper, faster and more tech savvy. It makes more sense to provide the $4000 credits when a person is 30 years old. 

The incentives for ITE studens are horrible. $10,000 put into their CPF or pesa account is as good as not giving anything. Liquid cash would be a more practical incentive than putting it into CPF which essentially is just giving GIC/temasak holdings more money to do risky investments.

@user-dw3od3jo6m,"Simply a colossal waste of money. Put that in a single fund. Those who have the will for it should make an application, then you release however much funds they require. I completely do not believe 40, 50, 60 year olds would be spending time to train. And $4,000 wouldn't be sufficient to gain any new skills to a degree that would be considered competent.

I took a gander at the SkillFuture courses. I'd say over half of them are completely worthless with regards to upskilling yet charging thousands of dollars. This whole program looks like a money laundering scheme. There's no quality control. 

Look at this shit: 32 hours, introductory course, charges nearly $2k. A Udemy course would set you back $20 for the same thing.

@user-dw3od3jo6m,"What's the point in giving 40+ year olds that money? They're never going to use it. It'd be better spent on the 20+ year olds, especially the non-degree fellas. Any upskilling and reskilling that actually matter take time. A 40 hour part-time introductory course isn't going to land you any meaningful job that's not already within your current skillset. This age group won't go into unemployment for months and months to 'skill up'. If they have a job, they are holding on to it for dear life, because who knows when they're going to find another job at that age. And if they don't have a job, they need a job ASAP.  Singaporeans aren't rich enough to be forgoing paychecks to 'learn'. You have family, kids and house? Even more unlikely. Which is why it makes more sense to target the 20 year olds, because they have none of those burdens on their minds. SkillsFuture has been running for quite some time already. What do you have to show for it? Nothing. Invest in the workforce and pay them to go to school. Do that or do nothing.

@youtuberschannel12,"Real and effective policies -> Introduce defence tax for foreigners. Tax all new citizens and 1st gen PRs, 2 years of their full-time salary in exchange for NSF allowance. Give that money to all NSmen.

Introduce economic national service. Make them serve 2 years full time and 10 cycles of reservist. Make them do construction work or any job that is not valuable for Singaporeans to do. Then there is no need to import so many foreign workers. Overpopulation and housing issues are all solved.

Malaysians should be taxed 3.5x their salary to make it fair for Singaporeans. These taxes not only protect our economy and the Singdollar by preventing them from sending money back to their country, it can also be reinvested in Singapore and Singaporeans
