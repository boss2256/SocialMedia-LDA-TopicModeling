# Social-Media-LDA-Analysis

A comprehensive analysis of social media data using LDA topic modeling to uncover key themes and insights.

## Overview

This project involves collecting and analyzing social media data from platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Reddit. The primary goal is to identify and understand the underlying topics discussed in the collected data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. The analysis provides insights into key themes such as financial concerns, political sentiment, social and economic issues, public services, and quality of life.
